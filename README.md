# Thank for accomplish of Lattice-Boltzmann-Simulation

Thank you for an article from Philip Mocz , (https://medium.com/@philip-mocz) if you want to study coding about physics which you can choice to study from blog of him.

# Consider 
If you observe the system by view point of Macroscopic. you will hardly to understanding the natural becuase of viewpoint this is complexly to consider the system at observe so whether you must to studies about Marcoscopic and Navier-Stokes , etc could to understanding a fundermental theorem of Lattice Boltzmann Method, which that is important concept and consist of Marcoscopic. but you should to accept a main idea about thermodynamics between static machine to connection viewpoint of Microscopic to Macroscopic by Mesoscopic

# Update now
-  ***[1/10/22]*** I fixed the generator image to the frame's image ,which look like vdieo frame by frame

# Bug and Problems 
-  ***[31/10/22]*** I think my coding is a problem due to this using more time to calculate and plot,which might mean the algorithm is not best to use
